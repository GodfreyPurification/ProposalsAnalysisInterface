Project Components:
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication using Flask-Dance with Google OAuth. This ensures secure access to the platform and provides a personalized experience for each user.
Frontend Development:

Design and develop an intuitive and responsive user interface using HTML and CSS. The interface will be user-friendly, allowing teams to easily input funding proposals.
Backend Development:

Utilize Flask as the backend framework to handle user requests and manage the application's logic.
Incorporate Flask-Dropzone for seamless file uploads, allowing users to submit Word files containing funding proposals.
Integration with ChatGPT:

Leverage the OpenAI GPT-3 API for interactive analysis of funding proposals.
Implement a backend function to generate ChatGPT responses based on proposal details provided by users.
Dropbox Integration:

Integrate the Dropbox API to enable users to upload, store, and manage their funding proposals.
Implement a backend function to securely upload submitted Word files to the user's Dropbox account.
Security Measures:

Implement secure coding practices to protect against common vulnerabilities.
Ensure that user authentication and data transfer are encrypted for confidentiality.
Testing:

Conduct thorough testing of the application, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.
Address and resolve any identified bugs or issues.
Documentation:

Provide comprehensive documentation for users, administrators, and developers.
Include a user guide explaining how to use the interface, authenticate, and manage proposals.
Deployment:

Deploy the application on a secure hosting platform, ensuring availability and reliability.
Set up continuous integration and deployment processes for efficient updates.
Expected Outcomes:
A fully functional user interface that enables teams to securely authenticate, input funding proposals, and engage in interactive analysis using ChatGPT.
